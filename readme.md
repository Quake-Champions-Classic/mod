## <p align=center> ***PURE SPEED. PURE SKILL. PURE FPS.***<br>

Quake Champions Classic seeks to mix the champion gameplay and balance from ***Quake Champions*** with the retro  aesthetics and community expandability of both the multiplayer and singleplayer of the original ***Quake***.<br>

To that end, the weapons have all been rebalanced to the current live build of _Quake Champions_, including both damage and ammo count. Champions themselves will be translated as closely as possible.<br>

If you're interested in contributing to the mod (not just ideas or requests, please), feel free to reach out to me, **RhapsodyInGeek**, on either the [**Quake Mapping Discord**](https://discord.gg/f5Y99aM) or the [**Blue Key Games Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/XAw2a8fQPX).

## Notes

This has largely been a study and exercise for me in game design while I take small breaks from my actual semi-professional game project, [***They Came From Dimension X***](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2115890/They_Came_From_Dimension_X/). As such, updates on this can take awhile. I do intend to "finish it" however, and plan on adding to it as time goes by.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this little hobby project of mine! Let me know in the Slipseer Discussion if you'd like to contribute or even just what you think of it! <3
