Version 12
Additions
- New champion: Gordon Freeman.
- New map: The Vale of Pnath.
- New music: "The Netherworld" (track34.ogg) Based off of Andrew Hulshult's "Ithagnal" track in Quake Champions.
- Add "skin" property to qcc_prop_dynamic in qcc.fgd.
- Add "wait" property to trigger_counter in qcc.fgd. Wait is used as the reset value when a counter reaches zero.
- Add new "qccSpeakDamaged" property, to allow for extra sounds on getting hurt. Used with Gordon's HEV suit.
- Add new "QCC_FL_FAST_MELEE" flag, for quicker melee characters like Gordon and Dusk Dude.
Changes
- Crucible and Insomnia now have map names instead of just filenames when displaying map info in game.
- "qccSpeakFrag" and "qccSpeakDamage" now use the QCC_SpeakCombatNull method as the default.
Bug Fixes
- Plugged a leak in Insomnia.
- isHordeMode resets state on New Game. This previously would cause unexpected crashes on Hourglass pickup when starting a new game after playing a Horde Mode map in Ironwail, possibly other engines.
