Changes:
- Cooldowns increased from 45 to 60 seconds. They now use a global cooldown constant in case it needs to be changed later. Champions with shorter cooldowns (Keen, Keel) now divide against that global cooldown constant, so that they still provide the same number of uses.

- Scalebearer Bull Rush damage reduction reduced from 67% to 50%.
- Scalebearer Bull Rush shoot delay is now set to 0.4 seconds.
